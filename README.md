# Restaurant Page

A completed project from the Odin Project curriculum

Live Demo:https://olvbrntly.github.io/restaurant-page/

A simple restaturant page made entirely in Javascript relying on modules, webpack and Dom manipulation

This project really solidified my knowledge with Modules and helped me to understand them much better.

This site is simplistic and NOT yet responsive to mobile devices.
I intend to come back and include that feature later on.
